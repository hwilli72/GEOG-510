# Lab 2: Markdown and Jupyter Notebook
This lab is designed to help you get familiar with Markdown and Jupyter Notebook. You will learn how to use Markdown to write documents and how to use Jupyter Notebook to write Python code and run it. You will also learn how to use Git to manage your code and documents.

## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

### Hyperlinks
Markdown allows you to create hyperlinks within the text. For example, the following is a link to [Google](https://www.google.com/).
