## Lab 2: Markdown and Jupyter Notebook
This lab is designed to help you get familiar with Markdown and Jupyter Notebook. You will learn how to use Markdown to write documents and how to use Jupyter Notebook to write Python code and run it. You will also learn how to use Git to manage your code and documents.

 ### Markdown
  Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

1. #### Hyperlinks  
    Markdown allows you to create hyperlinks within the text. For example, the following list contains various links to websites.   
      *[Google](https://www.google.com/)  
      *[My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/hwilli72)  
      *[Information on Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)  

2. #### Images  
    This image shows me sharing my research on *Beneficial social impacts of urban green spaces in Knox County, Tennessee* at the 2022 Discovery Day for undergraduate research.

3. #### Code blocks  
    Code blocks are used to display code in a document. To do so, just surround the code with three backticks. For example, the following code block contains Python code.
    
    '''python
    def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")
    '''

4. #### Inline code
    Inline code is used to highlight code within a sentence. To do so, just surround the 'code' with a single backtick. 'I can write this entire sentence in inline code.'

5. #### YouTube videos  
    Markdown also allows you to embed YouTube videos in your documents. The following are links to good music for studying.
